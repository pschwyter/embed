# Chaperone2
Version 2 of the Ada embed script.

Chaperone2 provides the same functionality as Chaperone, but with modern development tools to increase reliability, as well reduce development time.

Some of these tools include:

[PreactJS](https://preactjs.com/): A fast 3kB alternative to React with a stripped down API.

[Jest](https://jestjs.io/): For unit testing.

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Static typing, in lieu of `propTypes` (which the current version of Preact does not currently support).

[TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/): Linter for TypeScript.

[Sass-Lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint): Linter for `sass` and `scss`.


Webpack is also used under the hood and can be modified via the `preact.config.js` file.

## Setup
To get started, simply run `yarn && yarn start`. This will start a local development server at `http://localhost:8080/`. To make use of `tslint` and `sasslint`, you will need to install the `TypeScript TSLint Plugin` and `Sass Lint` extensions in the text editor of your choice.

## Beta branch and Deployment ###
The `beta` branch is set as the base branch for this repo. All PRs should be merged into the `beta` branch 1st, this deploys a beta embed script for testing `embed.beta.js`  at `https://static.ada.support/` for testing.

After robust testing, only the `beta` branch should be merged directly into `master` with admin approval

Chaperone2 is setup to deploy automatically on merge to the `master` branch, using CircleCI, generating 2 Chaperone2 scripts `embed.js` and `embed.[git-hash 1st 8 chars].js` at `https://static.ada.support/`
